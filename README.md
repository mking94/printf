# _printf
In this project we are going to recreate the C standard library printf function as a part of the curriculum of software engineering for the low-level programming module at Holberton School.

# Usage
To use the _printf function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed, compile all .c files in the repository and include the header holberton.h with any main function.

# Compilation
Our code is compiled this way:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c

# Format
%c print a single character.

%d print a decimal (base 10) number.

%i print an integer in base 10.

%s print a string of characters.

%% print a percent sign (% also works).

%o print an unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal.

%x or %X print unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the let- ters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.

# Files
File Name Description (_printf.c) produces output according to a format

File containing functions for specifiers _putchar.c

File containing function that writes a char to stdout (f_print1.c, f_print2.c)

File containing functions for more specifiers (holberton.h) header file with function prototypes and struct for specifiers.

# About
Created on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Compiled with gcc 4.8.4, using flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
